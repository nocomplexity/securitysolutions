## Missing a great FOSS Cyber security solution?


:::{tip}
Let me know by creating an issue on [Github](https://github.com/nocomplexity/securitysolutions)
:::


There are more than millions of different FOSS cyber security products published and available. So the collection in this publication is a very opinionated selection. 

Core selecting criteria are:
* The product must have a valid FOSS license. So an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses/).
* The security product must be active and meet a minimal quality level. 
* The security product must have a version-controlled source repository that is publicly readable and has a URL. 
Ideal is of course that all projects meet minimal requirements as outlined in the [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en). But despite endless energy and efforts this program is still not widely known. 
* We avoid listing FOSS security solutions that are FOSS *in name only*. Often this are solutions that are complex and created by companies or project have no open community, open governance and lack transparency.

 Our philosophy to create this collection of great FOSS security solutions is to simplify search and promote usage. We love security tools that are easy to use or adjusted. We do not aim to collect all solutions. This is practically impossible and offering an easy to use overview of the most common, best and well maintained solutions is than no longer possible. So this list is very opinionated.

:::{warning}
But please **note**:
Only FOSS solutions will be taken into account!

:::{note} 
All URLs for all Security Solutions are automatically checked periodically. 
Since the Sphinx link check tool is rather slow and misses some crucial features, we use our own FOSS tool for this.
