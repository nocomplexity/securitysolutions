Note:
 - Created date: *date* that repository is created on Github.com. 

- Last update: Latest date an update of repository is detected **on {sub-ref}`today`**. 

- Do not attach much value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Star counts are misleading and 
**don't** indicate if the SBB is high-quality or popular.
