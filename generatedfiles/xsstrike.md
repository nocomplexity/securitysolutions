## Description 

XSStrike is a Cross Site Scripting detection suite equipped with four hand written parsers, an intelligent payload generator, a powerful fuzzing engine and an incredibly fast crawler.Instead of injecting payloads and checking it works like all the other tools do, XSStrike analyses the response with multiple parsers and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis integrated with a fuzzing engine.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
