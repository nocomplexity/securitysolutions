## Description 

The encrypted ClientHello (ECH) mechanism (draft-spec) is a way to plug a few privacy-holes that remain in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that's used as the security layer for the web. OpenSSL is a widely used library that provides an implementation of the TLS protocol. The DEfO project has developed an implementation of ECH for OpenSSL, and proof-of-concept implementations of various clients and servers that use OpenSSL as a demonstration and for interoperability testing.
