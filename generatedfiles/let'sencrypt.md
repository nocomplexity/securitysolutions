# Let's Encrypt

## Description 

Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA), run for the public’s benefit. It is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can. We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
