# Fail2Ban

## Description 

Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/auth.log and bans IP addresses conducting too many failed login attempts. It does this by updating system firewall rules to reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a configurable amount of time. Fail2Ban comes out-of-the-box ready to read many standard log files, such as those for sshd and Apache, and is easily configured to read any log file of your choosing, for any error you wish.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
