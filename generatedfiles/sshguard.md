# sshguard

## Description 

sshguard can read log messages from standard input (suitable for piping from syslog) or monitor one or more log files. Log messages are parsed, line-by-line, for recognized patterns. If an attack, such as several login failures within a few seconds, is detected, the offending IP is blocked. Offenders are unblocked after a set interval, but can be semi-permanently banned using the blacklist option.
