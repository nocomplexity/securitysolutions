# Vanir

## Description 

Vanir is a source code-based static analysis tool that automatically identifies the list of missing security patches in the target system. By default, Vanir pulls up-to-date CVEs from Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) together with their corresponding signatures so that users can transparently scan missing patches for an up-to-date list of CVEs. Check also https://security.googleblog.com/2024/12/announcing-launch-of-vanir-open-source.html.
