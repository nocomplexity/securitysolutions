# Aircrack-ng

## Description 

Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:    Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.    Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.    Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).    Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).All tools are command line which allows for heavy scripting. A lot of GUIs have taken advantage of this feature. It works primarily on Linux but also Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, as well as Solaris and even eComStation 2.

Note:
 - Created date is date that repro is created on Github.com. 

- Last update is only the last date I run an automatic check. 

- Do not attach a wrong value to github stars. Its a vanity metric! Stars count are misleading and 
don't indicate if the SBB is high-quality or very popular.
