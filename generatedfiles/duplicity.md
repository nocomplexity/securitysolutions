# duplicity

## Description 

Encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup using the rsync algorithm. Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup.
